# First-React-Project

My first project with React - Clothing Store

Web application built with **vite**, using **React** (JS+SWC), for an optimized and smooth user interface.
This application works like a virtual store: You can view products, add them to the cart, increase or
decrease the quantities, and see the total sum of the selected products- all with data persisted in the local Storage.
For this application the data is in the document from

## Technologies

-Vite
-React
-JS + SWC

## Data Source

This application is not connected to a real database.
Instead, it uses a local JSON file to simulate product data and cart behavior.
